# Catmull-Rom Spline System
A project that implements the use of Catmull-Rom splines to generate a smooth path.

The project visualises the spline using train tracks and shows a train following the generated path.

## My Focus
- Implemented Catmull-Rom spline interpolation from scratch
- Used control points to dynamically generate a curved path
- Applied the spline system to drive object movement along the path
- Ensured smooth interpolation and consistent motion over time

## Tech
- Engine: Unity 6
- Language: C#
- Concepts: Catmull-Rom splines, interpolation, vector maths, path-based movement

## What I Learned / Would Improve
- Strengthened understanding of spline mathematics and curve interpolation
- To improve I would research mesh generation as the train tracks were not well made.
